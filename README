Basically, it's a slightly lower tech version of InvisibleCastle.com

You use the dieroller.html to roll some dice, and then, use display.rb to view the resutls. Longterm goal is to emulate most of the functionality of Invisible castle.

Currently uses the format:
NdM for a roll of N dice with M sides.
If you add a ! to the end of the roll line, dice will reroll if they roll the largest number

If you add a > sign followed by a number, it will assume that you want to roll successes, and will only roll dice and count the number that come up higher than the number after the > sign
